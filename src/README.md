This is the source python script.
There are two version of the code:
1. `main_parse.py`
2. `main_parse_multiprocess.py`: the multiple process version of `main_parse.py`, which uses two processes for two tasks(by_zip or by_date). It is faster than `main_parse.py`

There is also a script `test.py` for unittest of functions in main_parse.py
